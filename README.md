### Core Features
- __Anonymous__:
  + NO user registration or personal info required, No email or phone number is required.
  + We use a key pair based ID, which called KID, a 32-byte public key. saved locally.
  + NO persistant messages on server side.
  
- __Security__
  + Using ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to ensures key messages(eg, KID) integrity and authenticity.
  + Using ECDH (Elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman) to generate a shared AEAD key for private chat.
  + Using XChacha20Poly1305 to encrypt all messages of all chat types.
  + Using pure-rust cryptography implementation to provide fast & safe E2EE feature.
  + Memory Safety: Rust prevents buffer overflows and memory vulnerabilities

> ECDSA & ECDH implementation: Curve25519 (from [dalek-cryptography](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography))
> XChacha20Poly1305 implementaion: [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto)
